# VR Guided Dissection and Anatomy Exploration

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive VR experience designed to aid in the study of human anatomy, with a specific focus on guided dissection and part labeling of the human heart. It also includes anatomy layer setups without labeling and an integrated quiz system to enhance learning.

## Features

1. **Guided Heart Dissection**
   - Step-by-step guided dissection of the human heart.
   - Interactive labeling of heart parts for a better understanding of anatomy.

2. **Human Anatomy Layers Setup**
   - Layered anatomical views of the human body.
   - Exploration of anatomy without part labeling for independent learning.

3. **Integrated Quiz System**
   - Interactive quizzes to test knowledge and retention.
   - Questions directly related to the dissection and anatomy explored.

## Technology Stack
- **Unity 3D**: For creating immersive VR experiences.
- **C#**: For scripting and logic implementation.
